Key concepts of HTTP for backend engineers:

1. HTTP Introduction and Core Principles (0:00 - 5:48)
Statelessness: HTTP has no memory of past interactions. Each request is self-contained and must carry all necessary information (headers, auth tokens) for the server to process it. Benefits include simplicity and scalability (requests can be distributed across multiple servers).
Client-Server Model: The client (browser/app) initiates communication, and the server processes the request and sends a response (HTML, JSON, etc.).

2. Evolution of HTTP (5:49 - 7:30)
HTTP/1.0: Opened a new TCP connection for every request/response, which was inefficient.
HTTP/1.1: Introduced persistent connections (keep-alive), allowing multiple requests over one TCP connection. Added chunked transfer and caching mechanisms.
HTTP/2.0: Introduced multiplexing (multiple requests over one connection), binary framing, header compression, and server push.
HTTP/3.0: Built on the QUIC protocol (over UDP instead of TCP) for faster connection establishment and better handling of packet loss.

3. HTTP Messages Structure (7:31 - 9:08)
Request: Contains Method, URL, Version, Headers, and optional Body.
Response: Contains Version, Status Code, Headers, and optional Body.
A blank line separates headers from the body.

4. HTTP Headers (9:09 - 16:22)
Headers are key-value pairs representing metadata.
Request Headers: `User-Agent` (client type), `Authorization` (credentials), `Accept` (preferred content types).
Response Headers: `Content-Type` (data format), `Set-Cookie` (session management).
Security Headers: `Content-Security-Policy` (prevents XSS), `X-Frame-Options` (prevents clickjacking), `X-Content-Type-Options` (prevents MIME sniffing).
Headers offer extensibility and act as remote control instructions for the server.

5. HTTP Methods and Idempotency (16:23 - 20:06)
Methods define the intent of the action.
Idempotent Methods: Multiple identical requests have the same effect as a single request (`GET`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, `HEAD`, `OPTIONS`).
Non-Idempotent Methods: Multiple requests may result in different states (`POST` creates new resources each time).

6. OPTIONS Method and CORS (20:07 - 38:50)
CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing): A browser security mechanism protecting cross-origin requests.
Pre-flight Request (`OPTIONS`): The browser sends a pre-flight `OPTIONS` request to check if the server allows the actual request (e.g., a `PUT` request with custom headers) from the specific origin.
CORS Headers: `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`, `Access-Control-Allow-Methods`, `Access-Control-Allow-Headers`.
Max-Age: Caches pre-flight results to improve performance.

7. Response Status Codes (38:51 - 55:19)
2xx (Success): `200 OK`, `201 Created`, `204 No Content` (e.g., successful pre-flight).
4xx (Client Errors): `400 Bad Request`, `401 Unauthorized`, `403 Forbidden` (no permission), `404 Not Found`, `409 Conflict` (resource already exists).
5xx (Server Errors): `500 Internal Server Error`, `502 Bad Gateway`, `503 Service Unavailable`, `504 Gateway Timeout` (upstream server failed to respond).

8. HTTP Caching (55:20 - 1:02:28)
Stores responses to reduce server load and latency.
Cache-Control: Defines how long a resource is cached (`max-age`).
ETag: A hash identifier for a version of a resource. The client sends this back in subsequent requests (`If-None-Match`) to check if the resource has changed.

9. Content Negotiation and Compression (1:02:29 - 1:08:50)
Negotiation: Client specifies preferences via headers (`Accept` for type, `Accept-Language`, `Accept-Encoding`).
Compression: Servers compress data (e.g., `gzip`) if supported by the client to reduce payload size.

10. Persistent Connections and Large Data (1:08:51 - 1:15:17)
Keep-Alive: Explicit header to maintain connections.
Multipart Data: Used for uploading large files (binary data) in parts.
Chunked Transfer: Server sends large responses in chunks rather than all at once (often used with `Transfer-Encoding: chunked`).

11. SSL, TLS, and HTTPS (1:15:18 - End)
SSL/TLS: Protocols for encrypting data in transit to prevent interception.
HTTPS: HTTP running over a TLS connection.
